# binary-optimizer

This is a compact, Palantir-ready project demonstrating systems thinking through an AI-assisted binary pattern optimization engine. It is structured to impress reviewers with clarity, creativity, and technical depth.

## Palantir-Style Reasoning Memo

### Project Overview
The `binary-optimizer` is designed to find repeating binary patterns in sequences and intelligently compress or reorganize them. It leverages both linear heuristics and a small neural model to evaluate the importance of patterns, combining explainability with learned efficiency insights.

### Technical Highlights
- **PatternFinder**: Extracts candidate patterns efficiently with frequency and estimated savings calculations.
- **SimpleAIHeuristic + TinyBinaryModel**: Combines a linear scoring method with a trainable 16-bit neural model for hybrid evaluation.
- **Optimizer**: Selects top-K patterns and performs token replacement while accounting for overhead, providing clear metrics of savings.
- **Training Harness**: Generates synthetic data to train the neural component, demonstrating end-to-end pipeline capability.

### Why This Stands Out
- **Systems Thinking**: Optimizations occur at the bit-pattern level, a low-level problem that showcases deep technical reasoning.
- **Creative AI Integration**: Neural scoring adds an AI-driven dimension to a traditionally algorithmic problem, demonstrating interdisciplinary skill.
- **Explainable & Extensible**: Modular design allows reviewers to follow logic and extend heuristics, aligning with Palantir’s builder philosophy.
- **Immediate Demonstrability**: Demo scripts and metrics allow reviewers to run the project and see tangible results quickly.

### Potential Extensions
- Replace neural heuristic with transformer/LSTM for sequence-aware scoring.
- Add unit tests, benchmarking, and CI integration.
- Develop visualization tools to show pattern selection over time.

### Palantir Fellowship Alignment
This project demonstrates:
- Nontraditional problem-solving and builder mindset.
- Low-level computational optimization.
- Integration of AI for practical efficiency improvements.
- A clear, concise demonstration of technical capability and reasoning.

By combining all of the above, this project directly exemplifies the qualities sought in the Neurodivergent Fellowship: innovative thinking, clarity, and real-world impact potential.
