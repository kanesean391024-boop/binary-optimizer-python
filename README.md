# binary-optimizer

This canvas contains a minimal, working Python project skeleton that demonstrates an
"AI-Assisted Binary Pattern Optimization Engine" — a small prototype that analyzes
binary sequences, finds high-value patterns, and runs simple heuristics to
compress/reorder them.

# binary-optimizer

A small prototype demonstrating AI-like heuristics for finding and optimizing
binary patterns within sequences. Intended as a compact, Palantir-ready
portfolio project showcasing systems thinking and algorithmic creativity.

```

## How to run

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (none required for the
   skeleton; you can add `numpy` or `scikit-learn` later):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
python demo.py
```

2. Inspect `optimizer/` and `demo.py`. The demo runs a short example and
   prints optimization metrics.

## What to add next
- Integrate a small transformer or LSTM heuristic (optional)
- Add unit tests
- Add benchmarking harness
```
```
